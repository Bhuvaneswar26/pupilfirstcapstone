# üéì Pupilfirst Capstone Project

Welcome to the Pupilfirst Capstone Project! This project serves as the culmination of the WD201 course, offered by Pupilfirst. As a Learning Management System (LMS), our goal is to provide a comprehensive platform for educators to create and manage courses, and for students to sign up, enroll in courses, and access learning materials. This project aims to showcase our skills in web development and our understanding of building user-friendly educational platforms.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications.
- Express: A web application framework for Node.js, providing features for building web servers and APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database system.
- Sequelize: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Node.js, used to interact with PostgreSQL databases.
- EJS: A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.
- Express Generator: A tool to generate the initial project structure for Express applications.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern for organizing code and separating concerns. This pattern helps maintain a clear and modular structure, making it easier to manage and scale the application over time.

### Model

The Model component represents the data and business logic of the application. In this project, models are responsible for interacting with the database, defining the structure of data, and enforcing validation rules.

### View

The View component is responsible for presenting data to the user and handling user interface interactions. In this project, views are implemented using EJS templates, which allow for dynamic generation of HTML content based on data from the models.

### Controller

The Controller component acts as an intermediary between the model and view. It receives user input, processes requests, and interacts with the model to retrieve data or perform actions. In this project, controllers handle routing logic, validate input, and coordinate the flow of data between the model and view.

## üß™ Testing

The project includes a comprehensive testing suite implemented with Jest. Jest is a JavaScript testing framework that ensures the reliability and correctness of the application's codebase.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```
npm test
```

Executing this command will initiate the testing process and provide

 feedback on the test results, including any failures or errors encountered during testing.
